# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction
## Supervised classification ML project
The data comes from a cardiovascular research that is being conducted on people living in Framingham, Massachusetts. Predicting whether the patient has a 10-year chance of developing coronary heart disease is the categorization goal (CHD). The dataset contains information on the patients. There are 15 qualities and more than 4,000 records in it. Every quality carries the chance of risk. Risk factors include demographic, behavioural, and medical concerns.
